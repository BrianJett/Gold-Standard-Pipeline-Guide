## **Input**

- **Research Questions**: A set of research questions related to gene-cancer relationships.
- **Dataset**: Datasets including clinical data and gene expression data.

## **Output**

- **Regression Model**: Utilize a regression model to fit high-dimensional gene data, clinical data, and cancer diagnosis status to explore the relationship between genes and cancer.
- **Discussion**: Analyze and discuss the coefficients and significance of the regression model to draw conclusions related to the research questions.
